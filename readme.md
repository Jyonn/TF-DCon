# TF-DCon Dataset

This repository contains the content-based recommendation dataset used in the paper TF-DCon.
It contains four types of data:

- original full data
- random sampled data
- majority sampled data
- TF-DCon condensed data

All four types of data share the same user history and test set.

Our experiments are conducted on three widely used datasets:

- MovieLens-100K (movie recommendation) 
- Goodreads (book recommendation)
- MIND (news recommendation)

We also provide GPT-generated condensed content and user interests in the `raw_data` folder.
